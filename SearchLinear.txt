Definition:
Linear search is a straightforward searching algorithm that checks every element 
in a list sequentially until the desired element is found or the list ends.

Steps of Linear Search:

Initialization: Start from the first element of the list.
Comparison: Compare the current element with the target element.
Match Check: If the current element matches the target, return the current index (or True).
Continue: If the current element does not match the target, move to the next element.
End of List: If the end of the list is reached and the target element has not been found, return -1 (or False).

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(1)
Average Case:O(n/2)
Worst Case: O(n)
