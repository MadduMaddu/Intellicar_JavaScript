Definition:
Insertion Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the 
final sorted array one item at a time. It is much like the way you might sort playing cards in your hands.

How It Works:
Start with the second element (element at index 1) of the array as the key element.
Compare the key element with the elements before it.
Shift all elements greater than the key element one position to the right.
Insert the key element at the correct position.
Repeat the process for all elements in the array.

Time Complexity
Best Case: 𝑂(𝑛) - The array is already sorted.
Average Case: 𝑂(𝑛2) - Each insertion involves a comparison with half of the already sorted portion.
Worst Case: 𝑂(𝑛2) - The array is sorted in reverse order.

Space Complexity: 𝑂(1) - Only a constant amount of extra space is required.
