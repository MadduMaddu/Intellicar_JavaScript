Definition:
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves,
sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves to produce the sorted array.

How It Works
Divide: Divide the unsorted array into two approximately equal halves.
Conquer: Recursively sort both halves.
Combine: Merge the two sorted halves to produce the final sorted array.

Time Complexity
Best Case: 𝑂(𝑛log⁡𝑛) - Array is divided into two halves in 𝑂(log⁡𝑛)
                      and merging two halves takes 𝑂(𝑛).
Average Case: 𝑂(𝑛log⁡𝑛)
Worst Case: 𝑂(𝑛log⁡𝑛)

Space Complexity
Space Complexity: 𝑂(𝑛) - Requires temporary arrays for merging.
