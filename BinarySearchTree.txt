# Tree:
A tree is a hierarchical structure and Non-Linear data structure.
where as Array ,Linkedlist and stack ,Queue are Linear data structure.

The terms:
Root Node, Leaf Node, Degree, Height, Edge, Siblings

## Binary Search Tree:
A tree Which contains at most Two children
1—>the left child should contain the nodes less than the root node
2—>the right child should contain the nodes greater than the root node.

**Operations:**
1.insertion
2.searching
3.deletion
4.BFS & DFS

**Binary Search Tree Usage:**
1.Searching
2.Sorting
3.to-toimplement Abstract data types such as lookup tables and priority queues

### Traversing Ways:
1. Depth first search
    1.1. Pre-order 
    1.2. In-order
    1.3. Post-order
2. Breadth  First Search 

### DFS:
**Pre-Order Traversal:**
1—>read the data of the root
2—>visit the left sub-tree
3—>visit the right sub-tree

**In-Order Traversal:**
1—>visit left sub-tree
2—>read root data
3—>visit right sub-tree

**Post-Order Traversal:**
1—>visit left sub-tree
2—>visit right sub-tree
3—>read root data

### BFS:

1—>create a Queue
2—>enqueue the root node
3—>as long as the node exist in the queue   
    1. dequeue the node from the front
    2. read the nodes value
    3. enqueue the node’s left child if it exist
    4. enqueue the node’s right child if it exist

### Deletion:
1—>deleting leaf node
2—>deleting node which contain one child
3—>deleting Intermediate node


Search Operation:
Best Case: 𝑂(1) - When the target element is at the root.
Average Case: 𝑂(ℎ) - Where ℎ is the height of the tree.
Worst Case: 𝑂(𝑛) - When the tree is skewed (all nodes are either to the left or right), 
            making the height equal to the number of nodes.

Insertion Operation:
Best Case: 𝑂(1) - When inserting into an empty tree.
Average Case: 𝑂(ℎ) - Inserting into a balanced tree.
Worst Case: 𝑂(𝑛) - When inserting into a skewed tree.


Deletion Operation:
Best Case: 𝑂(1) - When deleting a leaf node in a balanced tree.
Average Case: 𝑂(ℎ) - Deleting a node in a balanced tree.
Worst Case: 𝑂(𝑛) - When deleting a node in a skewed tree.
